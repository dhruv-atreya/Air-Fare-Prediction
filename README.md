## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting air fares using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical fare data and various influencing factors, we aim to build models that can accurately forecast future air fares.

## Data Description
The primary dataset used in this project contains information about air fares, typically in a CSV format. Key features in the dataset include:

- `date`
- `airline`
- `source_city`
- `destination_city`
- `departure_time`
- `arrival_time`
- `fare`
- `class`
- `duration`
- `number_of_stops`

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dhruv-atreya/air-fare-prediction-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd air-fare-prediction-project
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the fare data file in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Air_Fare_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate the results.

## Modeling
The project includes various machine learning models to predict air fares. Key steps include:

- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training and Evaluation

Some of the techniques used are:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Results
The results of the analysis and predictions are documented within the Jupyter Notebook. Key findings include:

- Factors influencing air fare prices
- Model performance metrics
- Visualization of fare predictions vs. actual fares
